//randomly generated ports made to work with cloudflare port mapping
//the following ports cannot be accessed directly through cloudflare
//use the admin login subdomain to access local-Minecraft and server-SSH-FTP
//use emilien.ml to access server-HTTP-HTTPS
//use info.emilien.ml to access server-WebInfo

//here is an example of an HTTPS request comming from a client
   client              -> cloudflare          -> router          -> server
   https://emilien.ml/ -> https://<IP>:25112/ -> 192.168.1.3:443 -> ::1:443
1. a request is sent to emilien.ml through the default 443 port
2. cloudflare maps this request to the server public IP address with a gibberish port
3. the router receives a request with said gibberish port, and maps it to port 443 in the local network
4. the server receives a normal HTTPS connection through port 443, as if there was no proxying

//essentially, the router listens for gibberish ports to prevent script kiddies
//from finding my public IP address through port 80 or port 22 scans
