## Intro

A little while ago, my father and I [created a recipe](Making-the-Sauce) for some of the world's most spicy hot sauce without breaking the bank. However, if we ever want to sell it as a product, we would need some sort of packaging to go along with it. We had already received tiny `1mL` glass bottles to put the sauce in, but that clearly wouldn't cut it.

Since I have some experience in UI design, I figured I would try and create **a small label** to put on the bottle as well as **a paper cover** to make it look professional.

## Graphic Design

Below are two screenshots and two photos of the packaging I designed using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and produced using [Vistaprint](https://www.vistaprint.ca/).

I chose to use a dark background along with _red-orange_ hues to intensify the fact that this sauce is incredibly spicy. It uses a simple _sans-serif_ font and has a white interior to give it a clean and modern look. On the rear side of the paper cover, I inserted a [dynamic QR code](https://www.qr-code-generator.com/solutions/dynamic-url-qr-code/) so that I can change where it points even after printing it permanently on paper.

If you have a close look at the _warning_ section, you might be able to notice the following:

> Do not ingest. May cause severe pain.

It may seem very contradictory to create hot sauce that cannot be ingested. However, it is in fact a very clever trick my father came up with...

> If we don't want to bother with food regulations, we'll simply maket it as non-consumable!

Legally, this product isn't hot sauce. It is simply _chili extract_ packaged in a certain way. There are even warnings telling the consumer to **avoid ingesting it and breathing its fumes**. Trying to sue us will be like trying to sue a company for having eaten the chemicals they produce. At least that's in theory!

## 3D Design

The only thing left to do was to find a way to hold the bottle inside the _paper cover_. I wanted to use a non-permanent solution so that it could be I used as a stand for the bottle instead of simply getting thrown away. Here is what I came up with:

Since the greater part of the design is only `0.6 mm` thick, the whole thing prints in under 15 minutes on my 3D printer, the [Ender 3](https://www.creality3d.shop/products/creality3d-ender-3-pro-high-precision-3d-printer). This was essential because, as everyone knows, the shorter the printing time, the larger the volume we can produce. After gluing it on the inside of the _paper cover_, I inserted the bottle in the 3D printed clip. Below are two photos of the final result.

## What's Next?

This is my first attempt at creating a commercial product, and it's been a great learning opportunity for me. My father and I have sold [a few bottles](../Making-the-Sauce/) to friends and family, but we'd like to get it up on an online store such as [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/) in the near future. If you'd like to give it a try right now, [hit me up](mailto:bricktech2000@gmail.com)!
