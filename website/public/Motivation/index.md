Yesterday, I received the following message from a fellow Computer Science student at [uOttawa](https://www2.uottawa.ca/en):

> I'm doing a personal project where I gather advice and insight from different innovators. So if you have time, I wanted to ask: how do you stay motivated (what drives you), and what is your advice to other students?

As it turns out, I had never spent any time thinking about this matter. After having gotten lost in my thoughts for the last few hours, I believe I found the answer. I do acknowledge it is quite ironic, but here goes:

> Learn to be bored.

Let me explain further.

## Why Are You Not Motivated?

I believe the human brain's [mesolimbic pathway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesolimbic_pathway), also known as its _reward pathway_, has not had enough time to adapt to the world we currently live in. Even though this word is starting to sound more and more like a cliché, **overstimulation** seems to be the main reason behind the lack of motivation I observed in my peers.

[Dopamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine) is commonly known as the _motivation drug_, or as the _feel-good hormone_. Essentially, it is the chemical that is released when one's brain is expecting a reward. Even though our brains are optimizing for its release, [tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance) to dopamine can be developed. As it turns out, this is a major problem. Whereas everyday activities such as social interactions and eating a good meal still release the same amount of dopamine as they did millions of years ago, the dopamine base level in people's brains has increased drastically in the last few decades through the use of the internet.

Consequently, I believe people are less motivated because **they have gotten used to higher levels of dopamine** in their everyday lives. Getting productive work done or spending hours talking with a friend just doesn't feel as good as it used to.

## What About Me?

> I was lucky.

Somehow, that's the truth. All the stars just happened to be aligned. I can't explain why, but I don't enjoy the things that usually release more dopamine than they really should. These include:

- Drinking coffee &mdash; I deliberately chose not to consume caffeine
- Drinking alcohol &mdash; I just can't seem to understand the point of it
- Browsing social media &mdash; I find it's such a waste of my time
- Eating junk food &mdash; Eating healthy is easier than I thought
- Listening to music &mdash; It makes no difference on my ability to focus

I hadn't realized that before, but I seem to unconsciously lower my dopamine base level by not engaging in those types of highly-stimulating activities. And, as explained in the previous section, I believe that a lower dopamine base level directly correlates with higher levels of motivation and focus.

[//]: # "One could say I live in a world in which I don't really have to look for motivation, as it just finds me; a world in which I don't really have to put in any effort, as I just enjoy what I do."

## My Recommendations

I would argue that the best way to stay motivated long-term and to regain the ability to focus for extended periods of time is to decrease the amount of artificial stimulation in your life.

However, it is crucial to understand that lowering your dopamine base level can't just be a [mindless one-month challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6tswCzKRZA). If you really want to experience its benefits, it has to be a life-long commitment. Try and increase the effort-to-dopamine ratio for the bullet points listed above. Below are a few concrete ideas you could start off with.

- Instead of binge-watching Netflix for hours, watch your favorite show with a friend in that **new language** you've been learning.
- Instead of mindlessly scrolling through social media, find a post that you like and send a direct message to its author to have a **meaningful conversation** with them.
- **Increase friction** for eating junk food: get your apocalyptic-sized chip bag supply on top of a hard-to-access shelf instead of storing it at arm's reach.
- When waiting in line, **talk to people** or **embrace boredom** instead of going on your phone to check what that guy who lives on the other side of the planet is up to lately.
- If you drink coffee every morning, try to cut the amount of caffeine you consume. If you smoke, don't. And if you do drugs, you shouldn't be reading this post. Seek professional help.

## Final Thoughts

This post discussed my opinion on motivation. Nevertheless, committing to this lifestyle without a thorough understanding of what it implies isn't a great idea. Do your own research, and take the decisions you believe are best for you.
