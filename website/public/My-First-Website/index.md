## My First Website...

I started programming a few years ago, and one of the first things I programmed was [this website](./client/index.html). It looks something like this:

I used to think that this website looked awesome, and that the design was great... However, when I look at it today, I see a disgusting font way too large for the screen, ugly colors, a blury background image, and much more. I remember showing it to my friends and they thought it was the most awesome thing ever, but now that I'm looking at it, it definetly is not the most awesome thing ever...

The system to handle the pages of the website is really strange: when you request a page on the website, it is loaded and displayed in an `iframe`, which is normally used to embed a whole other website within a website. Using this technique caused many bugs that were hard to track down, partly due to the quirks of `HTML`.

A well-known quote says the following:

> Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.

Despite that, my first website is just a jumbled mess of unreadable code.

If, for some reason, you would like to take a look at it for yourself, here is [a link](./client/index.html) to it.
