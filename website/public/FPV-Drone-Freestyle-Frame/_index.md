hey btw if you're reading this, the thingy down there is just a motivational speach from myself to myself for myself.

> I'm so **fed up** with school. never thought I'd say that, but grades are starting to have a negative impact on me. and that's pretty much the **last** thing a student would hope for. I just have no more motivation. if you think about it, that's selfishness at its purest. I put zero work in and expext results out. that's the way it has been for my whole life. thinking about it, I should really take this as a _hard kick in the butt_. if I don't hit that wall now, I'll probably do so once I get to university. and I can't afford to hit it then.

> dude, I think it's time you make a decision. _the decision of your life_. you learn to put work in, or you continue expecting success without any effort. and I'll be real honnest with you, that's not happening. that one concept you didn't understand in chemistry, well it cost you a good `31%` off your grade. you know what could've prevented that? completing a few exercises here and there. but you didn't. you never did it.

> the last `17 years` of your life were just like paradise. well I'm happy to anounce that this has just ended **right here**, **right now**. you're currently sitting on the apex of the quadratic function, and let me tell you, its curvature is negative as hell. if you start going down that path, you're screwed. for life. make that quadratic function a cubic function and change your mindset while you still can.
