## Preface

About one year ago, I got interested in _racing drones_. Youtubers such as [UAVfutures](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ioIOr3tH6Yz8qzr418R-g), [Joshua Bardwell](https://www.youtube.com/user/loraan), [Mr Steele](https://www.youtube.com/user/MrSteeledavis), [Rotor Riot](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCemG3VoNCmjP8ucHR2YY7hw) and many more make videos about this kind of drones, and I got hooked into it. They are very powerful machines that can go faster than `200 km/h`... and so I wondered,

> Why wouldn't I make one myself?

And this is where everything began.

## Demo

Here's a demo video on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGj6pfxZ0XYJU29XNwXPPxg/featured) that shows how much power a 2-inch racing drone can have:

And here's a picture of it (even if one motor is missing):

It actually flew, but one motor was defective, and so the inner windings melted together. This rendered it useless, so I am currently waiting on a spare. However, because of `COVID-19`, the shipping was delayed.

## How it was built

In order to build such a machine, _soldering_ and _problem-solving_ skills are a must. Since I had already tinkered with electronics before, building this quadcopter was not too hard to do. However, if you have never soldered or programmed before, I do not recommend try to build such a drone. Moreover, _Ready-to-Fly_ (or _RTF_) drones are now widely available, meaning that you do not have to build them from scratch.
