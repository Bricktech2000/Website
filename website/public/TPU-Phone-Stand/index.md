Overview
--------

This {phone stand:: https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Vlz6jJhSi4/maxresdefault.jpg} is a simple object that has proven to be very useful in everyday life. My friend Nicolas had the idea to make an openable stand that holds a smartphone from both of its sides in landscape mode. I loved it, so I decided to design a simpler version, using {flexible plastic:: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoplastic_polyurethane} instead of a hinge to both improve durability and make it simpler to produce.

Here are some of its defining features:

	* Very *simple to manufacture* due to its one-piece design.
	* Can adapt to *any size smartphone* thanks to it being produced out of TPU.
	* Can withstand *thousands of flexions* because of its optimized desing.
	* Allows for *2 different stand angles* thanks to its assymetric nature.
	* *Easy to carry* because of its compactness once folded up.

How to get one
--------------

If you wish to print one for yourself, here are the {STL files:: ./Phone Holder 2 v2.stl}. It is ment to be printed in a rather stiff TPU filament in order to be both flexible and rigid. I also used [60%] infill in order to get an even stiffer print than with the default [20%] infill percentage. Don't even attempt to print it in /PLA/ as it is simply not going to work.
