Blackbox Video Exporter
=======================
A program that turns a [Betaflight](betaflight) blackbox file into a video file

Requirements
------------
* Any browser with HTML5 support

Setup
-----
No special setup is needed. Simply open up `index.html` in a web browser to use the software.

How To Use It
-------------
1. Choose one of the following options:
    * Compile to WEBM (which compiles the blackbox file to a video file)
    * Render in real time (which allows you to see the blackbox video in real time)
2. Get a [Betaflight](betaflight) blackbox file and open it up in the software. There are three ways to do so:
    * Click on the link to directly download a sample `CSV` file to quickly try out the program
    * Use Betaflight's _tethered logging_ function to get a `CSV` file directly from the drone
    * Use Betaflight's _blackbox_ to output a `BFL` file, which you can convert to a `CSV` file using the [Betaflight Blackbox Explorer](blackbox-explorer)
3. Wait for the rendering to start, and hope &ndash; yes, hope &ndash; that no errors occur!
