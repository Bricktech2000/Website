## The Issue With Lectures

Let's get right to the point; below is a list of what I hate most about conventional lectures, in which a single teacher speaks in front of a group of students.

1. Teachers explaining using way too many examples and **unnecessary details**
2. **Student questions** related to concepts they should've mastered already
3. Teachers who clearly don't want to teach or who **don't enjoy teaching**

With a few years of lectures ahead of me, I knew I had to find some way to make my experience less miserable. This is where [Lecture Speedup](https://github.com/Bricktech2000/Lecture-Speedup) comes in.

## Lecture Speedup

[Lecture Speedup](https://github.com/Bricktech2000/Lecture-Speedup) is a quick script I made that injects key bindings onto any webpage containing a HTML `video` element through the JavaScript console. It works on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), [Zoom](https://zoom.us/), [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) and many websites, which makes it ideal for blazing through lecture recordings. Here is a list of the key bindings it implements:

- Up and down arrow increase and decrease the playback rate respectively
- Left arrow rewinds the video a set number of seconds
- Right arrow increases the playback rate significantly while it is held down
- Right shift key plays and pauses the video

Even though this script only solves the first two of the three issues I set out to resolve, it has proven extremely useful for learning concepts quicker. After a bit of self-promo on a Discord server for a programming class, other students even told me they used [Lecture Speedup](https://github.com/Bricktech2000/Lecture-Speedup) to study more efficiently before exams.

## Trying it Out

#try
If all that sounds appealing, you can give [Lecture Speedup](https://github.com/Bricktech2000/Lecture-Speedup) a go by following the instructions in the `README.md` on [the project's Github](https://github.com/Bricktech2000/Lecture-Speedup).

#demo
As a quick demo of the script, below is a video of me blazing through a lecture recording and taking notes on the material covered. Enjoy!
