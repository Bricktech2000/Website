## Intro

A few days ago, I received the _6S_ battery I had ordered for my drone. I used to fly it on _4S_ pack, since two of the cells on my older battery had puffed. Mathematically, the new battery should have `150%` the power of the older one, but in practice it's even more. Because of something called [battery sag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_sag), the drone has about twice the power with the new battery.

When I first tried it out, I immediately remembered what my friend Nicolas told me when he saw my drone for the first time:

> But what's the point of having that much power?

Now that I have received the new battery, I'm constantly asking myself the same thing. I can't raise the throttle for more than `1 second` or I would loose sight of it because it gains altitude so quickly. I also noticed that the power of my drone is the same both when the battery is full and when it is empty, which makes it way easier to fly.

## Demo

Here is a demo of the drone on a 6S battery, with a [blackbox preview](../Blackbox-Video-Exporter/) on the side:

## Conclusion

I am **incredibly** proud of this drone. To be honnest, it was a bit too easy to build: everything simply worked out perfectly. I can only think of one more upgrade to make it even better... an FPV system! [Here](./Demo-on-6S/fpvOrder.png) is a teaser for you curious people...
