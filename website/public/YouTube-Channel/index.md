## Why a YouTube Channel?

I have been doing _3D designing and printing_, _programming_, _robotics_ and _electronics_ for a while now. In December of last year, I thought:

> Why make projects when I don't even share them with the world?

This is the moment when I decided to create my YouTube channel, [TechnoViper](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGj6pfxZ0XYJU29XNwXPPxg/featured).
I really wanted to start sharing everything I do with the internet, and YouTube seemed like the ideal platform to do so.

## What is it All About?

As I said previously, I will share a bunch of my projects on my YouTube channel. This includes the following:

- **RC stuff** &#8212; _drones, cars, boats_
- **3D designing and printing** &#8212; _time lapses, tutorials_
- **Programming** &#8212; _arduinos, websites..._
- **Electronics** &#8212; _robotics, circuits, PCBs_
- Anything else I feel like sharing!

A few posts on this website will have a corresponding video on my YouTube channel, don't forget to [check it out](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGj6pfxZ0XYJU29XNwXPPxg/featured)!
