## Why a YouTube Channel?

I have been doing _3D designing and printing_, _programming_, _robotics_ and _electronics_ for a while now. In December of last year, I thought:

> Why make projects when I don't even share them with the world?

This is the moment when I decided to create my YouTube channel, [TechnoViper](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGj6pfxZ0XYJU29XNwXPPxg/featured).
I really wanted to start sharing everything I do with the internet, and YouTube seemed like the ideal platform to do so.

## What is it All About?

As I sait previously, I will share the projects I do on my YouTube channel. This includes...

- RC stuff (drones, cars, boats)
- 3D designing and printing (time lapses, tutorials)
- Programming (_arduino_, websites, etc.)
- Electronics (robotics, circuits, _PCBs_)
- Anything else I feel like sharing!

Almost every post on this blog will have a corresponding video on my YouTube channel, don't forget to [check it out](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGj6pfxZ0XYJU29XNwXPPxg/featured)!
