A few days ago, I watched {a video:: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tO5Ym6-H2Ac} from {Teaching Tech:: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbgBDBrwsikmtoLqtpc59Bw} on YouTube. It showcases various useful tools that can be 3D printed in a matter of minutes. While most of them seemed quite useless, some of them caught my attention. The following blog post will discuss *3 of my favorites*. Don't forget that you can download all the tools featured in this post by {clicking here:: ./Tools2.zip}!


Screw Measuring Device
----------------------

The first tool I really liked was a /screw measuring device/. It allows one to measure both *the diameter and the length of metric screws* in only a few seconds. Here are a few examples using different size screws:


<<<
  var path = '/pages/R963W/';
  yield include('../../body/partial/mosaic/img.html', {
    srcs: [
    	path + 'IMG_20210315_170725_8.min.jpg',
    	path + 'IMG_20210315_170801_5.min.jpg',
    	path + 'IMG_20210315_170817_1.min.jpg',
    	path + 'IMG_20210315_170834_9.min.jpg',
    ]
  })
>>>


Center Finder
-------------

The second tool I chose is a /center finder/. It makes finding *the center of a circle or of a rectangle* incredibly easy because of its clever design. Here is an example of what it can do:


<<<
  var path = '/pages/R963W/';
  yield include('../../body/partial/mosaic/img.html', {
    srcs: [
    	path + 'IMG_20210315_171106_7.min.jpg',
    	path + 'IMG_20210315_171234_2.min.jpg',
    ]
  })
>>>


Fillet Gauge
------------

The third tool I found very useful is a /fillet gauge/. While it is very easy to measure distances with some {callipers:: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calipers}, it is way harder to use them to measure *the radius of a fillet*. For this reason, this tool was created. Here are a few instances in which a fillet gauge can prove incredibly useful:


<<<
  var path = '/pages/R963W/';
  yield include('../../body/partial/mosaic/img.html', {
    srcs: [
    	path + 'IMG_20210315_171554_4.min.jpg',
    	path + 'IMG_20210315_171624_5.min.jpg',
    	path + 'IMG_20210315_171701_4.min.jpg',
    	path + 'IMG_20210315_171758_2.min.jpg',
    ]
  })
