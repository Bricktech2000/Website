## Choose Wisely

A soldering iron is one of the most important tools for an electronics enthousiast. Moreover, in the [world of FPV](../FPV-Drone-HD-Footage/), you will eventually cross paths with soldering, whether you want it or not.

The mistake most people will make is to buy a very cheap `20$` soldering iron and call it a day. However, unlike in many disciplines, one cannot be good at soldering if they only own low-quality soldering tools. For this reason, it is essential to choose your soldering iron wisely. This is exactly where the [SQ-D60 Type B](https://www.banggood.com/SQ-D60-60W-Digital-Soldering-Iron-Station-DC12-24V-Type-C-Interface-100-400-Adjustable-Temperature-p-1653661.html?cur_warehouse=USA&ID=511646&rmmds=search) comes in.

## The Review

The [SQ-D60](https://www.banggood.com/SQ-D60-60W-Digital-Soldering-Iron-Station-DC12-24V-Type-C-Interface-100-400-Adjustable-Temperature-p-1653661.html?cur_warehouse=USA&ID=511646&rmmds=search) is one of the cheapest high-quality soldering irons out there, coming in at about `35$`. I would highly recomment the `Type B` version, which is only `5$` more expensive but also includes an LCD display for precise temperature control. It is powered from `USB-C` and comes with an `XT60` adapter to plug it right into your LiPo flight packs. Available temperatures range from `100°C` to `400°C`, which is perfect for pretty much anything you might want to solder.

I have literally no complaints about this soldering iron. When plugged into a `6S LiPo`, it heats up to `400°C` in only about `15` seconds. Because of its `60W` rating, it is easily able to maintain its tip temperature, even when soldering `12-` and `14-AWG` wire. It is small and portable, which makes it very convenient to carry around when flying my [FPV Drone](../FPV-Drone-HD-Footage/). All in all, this is an awesome little soldering iron!

## Final Words

Specs-wise, the The [SQ-D60 Type B](https://www.banggood.com/SQ-D60-60W-Digital-Soldering-Iron-Station-DC12-24V-Type-C-Interface-100-400-Adjustable-Temperature-p-1653661.html?cur_warehouse=USA&ID=511646&rmmds=search) is identical to the _gold standard_ for portable soldering irons, the [TS-100](https://hackaday.com/2017/07/24/review-ts100-soldering-iron/). It uses the same tips and, according to [some sources](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcI2TR9hKhc), is manufactured in the exact same factory. You basically can't go wrong with it!
