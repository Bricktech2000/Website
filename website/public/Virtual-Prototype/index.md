## Preface

During the last year of high school in the [IB program](https://www.ibo.org/) (aka PEI), students need to do a very complex project called the _Personnal Project_. It is divided into 4 main sections: `Research`, `Planification`, `Action` and `Reflexion`. For my personnal project, which I started a few months ago, I decided to build a very fast quadcopter, often called a _[Racing Drone](https://www.google.com/search?q=racing+drone&safe=strict&tbm=isch)_. I had already built a drone before starting this project, which you can check out by [clicking here](../Racing-Drone/). However, it was `2.5` times smaller and about `5` times less powerful than the one I will build for my personnal project, which will spin `5"` propellers. This will be an awesome opportunity to learn a bunch about how drones work, but most importantly to work on my problem-solving skills.

## The Prototype

May 26th, I had the idea to try to make a virtual prototype of the drone in an [image editing software](https://pixlr.com/x/). Since I had already found all the necessary sources, I had a good idea of the pieces I would use for the drone. And so I started editing using [Paint 3D](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/paint-3d/9nblggh5fv99), but I quickly gave up because of the lack of functionnality of the software like the incapacity of working with images that have a trasparent backgorund. I ended up starting from scratch on an online editor called _[Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/x/)_, and it was way easier from then on. After 3 hours, I was done! Here's the prototype:

## The Parts Used

Here's a list of all the parts I will use to make this drone (keep in mind that I will not be using a camera nor a VTX, to keep the build as simple as possible):
