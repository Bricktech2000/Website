## The idea

I first got the idea of making such a system when I was creating [this very website](https://github.com/Bricktech2000/Website/). I had notes everywhere for keeping track of things I needed to do on the project: on my cell phone, on my computer, inside the code itself... After a while, it gets really messy and unorganized, so I thought to myself:

> I should totally make a program to handle it all for me!""

And so this is how [Tinker](https://github.com/Bricktech2000/tkr/) got to be.

## How to Use it

In order to download the program, you need to install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on a `Windows` or `Linux` computer, and then `git clone` the following: https://github.com/Bricktech2000/tkr.git

Once you have done so, you should have the full code copied on your own machine. Then, read the [[README.md]](https://github.com/Bricktech2000/tkr/) file in /Tinker/'s repository to get instructions on how to use it!

## Moving Forward

I think this small program will help me a lot when working on larger-scale projects. I have just initialized [Tinker](https://github.com/Bricktech2000/tkr/) on [this website](https://github.com/Bricktech2000/Website/) to help me track everything I need to do from now on. I will use it for a little while, and probably make an update to this post to let you know if it is any good!

## Update

Unfortunately, this website is not a good candidate for such a program. `TODO`s can simply be inlined exactly where they belong, and new features can be implemented in a few hours at most. Since I do not need to keep track of dozens of `TODO`s at once, I decided to uninstall [Tinker](https://github.com/Bricktech2000/tkr/) from this website.
