# Website Redesign

---

## Best Practices
* **find a purpose** for the website and put it right on the homepage

## Ideas and Stuff
* use `HSL `colors
* no nav bar
* probably a floating _back_ arrow with `box-shadow`
* animations?
  * a
* stop using tags for sorting posts
* card styles:
  * software: solid gray with `box-shadow`
  * hardware: light gray outline (maybe with `box-shadow`?)
  * blog posts: gradient `--color-primary` with `box-shadow` and `text-shadow`
* display the date at which posts were written

## Structure
* make a story, guide the user
1. landing page
  * fullscreen with picture on the right
  * _Let me show you what I can do._
  * animated _scrool down_ arrow
  * _I'm Emilien, a lorem ipsum._
  * buttons: _email_, _messenger_, _github_, _linkedin_, _resume?_,
2. _a bit more about myself_ (self-taught programmer, since when, learned electronics, 3d printing, etc.)
3. featured posts (maybe?)
4. posts with **new card styles**
